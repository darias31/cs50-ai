This repository contains my completed assignments for the CS50AI Course by Harvard University. 
All assignments were completed using the provided course materials and next-to-no use of generative AI. 

<h2>Week 0: Search</h2>

**Degrees:**

Developed an algorithm to find the degrees of separation between two actors using breadth-first search algorithm.

**Tic-Tac-Toe:**

Developed a functional tic tac toe game with AI opponent using minimax algorithm.

**ConnectFour (Personal Project):**

Developed a functional connect four game with AI opponent using minimax algorithm. Utilized alpha beta pruning and limited-depth search for enhanced performance.
