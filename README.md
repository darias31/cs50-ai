This reposity contains my completed assignments for the CS50AI Course by Harvard University. 
All assignments were completed using the provided course materials and next-to-no use of generative AI. 

**Week 0: Search**
    **Degrees:**
        Developed an algorithm to find the degrees of separation between two actors using breadth-first search algorithm.
    **Tic-Tac-Toe:**
        Developed a functional tic tac toe game with AI opponent using minimax algorithm.
    **ConnectFour (Personal Project):**
        Developed a functional connect four game with AI opponent using minimax algorithm. Utilized alpha beta pruning and limited-depth search for enhanced performance.
**Week 1: Knowledge**
    Knights:
        Implemented an AI algorithm to solve a game of Island of Knights and Knaves using boolean logic.
    Minesweeper:
        Implemenetd an AI algorithm to solve a game of minesweeper that uses given knowledge and boolean logic to derive new information and locate safe cells and cells with mines
